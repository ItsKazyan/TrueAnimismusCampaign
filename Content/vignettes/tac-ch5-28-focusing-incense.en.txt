Harriet (Left): Good morning, Ellie. The situation...might be more complicated than I thought.
Eleanor (Right): Of course it is.
Harriet (Left): I just visited the Symposium while they were setting up to see if I could punch Oswald, but there were some suspicious, out-of-place guards. It seemed like a very bad idea to get close.
Eleanor (Right): Knowing him, he doesn't want to let me in. Or you.
Harriet (Left): Definitely not. You should have seen him when I threatened him. He's scared of me out of his wits.
Eleanor (Right): Let me finish this one test, and then I'll make a plan.

Eleanor (Right): It works!
Eleanor (Right): Now we need to get me into the Symposium, upstage Oswald, and do something about those guards.
Harriet (Left): My fists are at your disposal.
