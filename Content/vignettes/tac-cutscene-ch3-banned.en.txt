Portraits: Eleanor (Left), Harriet (Right), Nadine (Left)

Eleanor (Left): And, and then he banned me from my owwwwn tranust--transtation engine without f...further work goes through him...
Harriet (Right): Ellie, sit. Sober up.
Eleanor (Left): But I! I! Am the one. Who took his notes. Right here.
Nadine (Left): If it were up to me, you'd present a book of medicinal breakthroughs at the symposium and let the attendees come to their own conclusions. We're a University. Research can and should come from anyone.
Nadine (Left): Recognition is profound, but it's not everything. You will save lives beyond measure with True Vitae.
Eleanor (Left): But how do I dooooo that when I can't use _my_ tramisution engine...
Nadine (Left): I may have a talk with the Symposium organisers directly. There's little that I can do officially, but in practice, it will be simple to write you in as the presenter instead of Oswald.
Eleanor (Left): I--I want to be a good alchemist.
Eleanor (Left): What am I supposed to show if he fights me on it...I don't have three super glyphs in me...
Harriet (Right): What else could she possibly do for medicine or decardination? It seems like you can build anything with _her_ glyphs.
Nadine (Left): Almost anything. Some products are very complex and difficult, and triplex bonds to vitae and mors are still impossible.
Harriet (Right): Oh. Yeah, I definitely have known what those were for more than maybe a day.
Eleanor (Left): I'm gonna _fix_ that! N...Nadine...I'm gonna fix the...
Nadine (Left): You have full access to my personal library and my production cabinets.
Harriet (Right): ...I love finally seeing her confident.
