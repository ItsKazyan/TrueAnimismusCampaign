Eleanor (Left): Thanks so much for making me breakfast this early.
Harriet (Right): You're welcome. I went to bed early last night, anyway. The fighting ring wore me out.
Eleanor (Left): Are you still on your winning streak?
Harriet (Right): 6th win in a row. I'm due for an actual beatdown soon.
Harriet (Right): Honestly, I'm excited.
Eleanor (Left): Hah!
Eleanor (Left): At any rate, I'll try not to drop crumbs on the engine. I just have to get this done for University projects.
Harriet (Right): I know. Good luck with the Glyph of Petrification research.
Eleanor (Left): Purification, silly.

-----------

Harriet (Right): I wish I had an alchemist's brain. I'll never understand how you can make sense of all this.
Eleanor (Left): Aw, it's easier when you know the glyphs. They make it obvious that I have to unbond the mors, purify, then put it back. 
Harriet (Right): ...you lost me. I can't hold that many steps in my head.
Eleanor (Left): Aw, it's okay.
Eleanor (Left): It's a shame I have to throw away so much perfectly good mors. It's too dangerous to have just laying around.
