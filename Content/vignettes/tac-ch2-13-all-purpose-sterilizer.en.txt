Harriet (Left): So I asked some more alchemists.
Harriet (Left): I didn't know which of the other glyphs might help, so I asked about all of them.
Eleanor (Right): Wow.
Harriet (Left): Is it okay if I just pile a bunch of notes on your engine and hope you can sort them out?
Eleanor (Right): That's perfect. Thank you.
Eleanor (Right): I just hope I can work through these before Oswald gets here. I'll have to use much from his reagents.

Harriet (Left): How did it go?
Eleanor (Right): I...think I have an idea.
Eleanor (Right): Projection leaps over the Purification hierarchy...maybe if I dissolve the atom like it's quicksilver instead of "painting" over it directly, and if the tube system is a completely perfect mirror under the base...I'll have to borrow ideas from triplex to make it work...
Oswald (Left): I'm back.
Oswald (Left): Why are all of those glyphs laying out? Eleanor, please put those back.
Oswald (Left): And you, non-assistant, get out of my office.
