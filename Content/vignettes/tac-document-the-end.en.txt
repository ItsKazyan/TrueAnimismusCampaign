[DO NOT PARSE]

The investigation into the academic fraud of Oswald Terrell, Al. D., is hereby approved on the basis of suspected plaigarism via theft of and uncredited use of research notes. Preliminary evidence suggested that esteemed professors H. Servin, A. Wallace, and G. Althus are all affected, at minimum--those least likely to cause complaint.

Anyone accused of actions with this gravitas is entitled to fair and due process, Oswald included. Some investigations, however, are open-and-shut cases. I do not expect it to take very long to establish the facts. Additionally, Oswald's Al. D. publication will be reivewed, and if found to be similarly plaigarised, the formal suspension of Oswald's Al. D. is likely.

The College of Alchemical Engineering is not a great House. We do not value duplicity as a means of ascent. Alchemy is not advanced by collecting power or prestige--it is done by transmutation engine and clever minds.
