Oswald (Right): Good morning, wonderful assistant!
Eleanor (Left): Shut up.
Oswald (Right): Excuse me?
Eleanor (Left): Since you're taking credit for both of my glyphs, I went ahead and made another one. It transfers animismus. I'm calling it the Glyph of Infusion.
Eleanor (Left): It can dilute animusmus so that true vitae and true mors are no longer the final fate of an atom. It can penetrate animismus far into a molecule. It has so many uses, you won't even care about the price.
Eleanor (Left): And _I_ made it. _Not you_. Just watch.

Eleanor (Left): Do you understand the kind of Alchemist I am, now? I have it on good authority that I'll be the one presenting for the Symposium.
Oswald (Right): ...well.
Oswald (Right): You've made your point very clear, I suppose. I'm humbled.
Oswald (Right): I really should be kinder to you--how about I buy you lunch? We'll get a good day of molecular research done.
Eleanor (Left): Yes. Thank you. As I'd hoped.
