Portraits: Harriet (Left), Bruiser

Pit Commentator: Heeeere we have it, folks, the Vicious Hare is meeting her match. What a fight!
Pit Commentator: I'm surprised anything's left of her after that hit, much less her getting back up!
Harriet (Left): Ghrk...
Bruiser: Had enough?
Harriet (Left): You wish.
Pit Commentator: Look at those kicks! She's a nightmare today! 
Bruiser: Grah! Stay _down_.
Audience: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!
Pit Commentator: She's gonna feel that in the morning, if she makes it that long! Old Earthquake is unstoppable!
Harriet (Left): Hah...ack..
Harriet (Left): Didn't...need that tooth anyway.
Bruiser: How many times do I have to break you before you stay broken?
Harriet (Left): You're one too short.
Bruiser: Oof! Urgh!
Pit Commentator: What's this? Are we seeing a turnaround, folks?
Audience: OOOOOH!
Harriet (Left): Bleed!
Bruiser: Guuuuuuuuh...
Harriet (Left): The ground looks good on you, #7.
Pit Commentator: There we have it! Lights out for Old Earthquake.
Pit Commentator: A killer blow to a giant's pride, everyone--a good hook, with her left hand...
