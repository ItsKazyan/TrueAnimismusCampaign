Harriet (Left): Hi.
Oswald (Right): Why is she here again?
Eleanor (Left): Sorry, I'm moving my transmutation engine here and I need someone strong. There's a lot of lead.
Oswald (Right): Well, set it up and leave. 
Harriet (Left): No.
Oswald (Right): Are you an Alchemist? Do you have an Al. D.? Do you know to transmute a crystal, any crystal?
Harriet (Left): Also no.
Oswald (Right): Then get _out_.
Oswald (Right): Eleanor, put your full focus on this transmutation, it's important.
Eleanor (Left): Fine. ...maybe it's time to open Nadine's package...

Eleanor (Left): Done.
Oswald (Right): So quickly?
Harriet (Left): Huh, your research notes are really disorganized.
Oswald (Right): Leave those alone.
Harriet (Left): What's in this drawer?
Oswald (Right): DO. NOT. TOUCH THOSE. Those most of all.
Eleanor (Left): ...come on, Harriet, let's go get dinner.
